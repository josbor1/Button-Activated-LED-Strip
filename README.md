# Button-Activated-LED-Strip

  This code will control a NeoPixel-style addressable LED strip by pressing a button to select preconfigured effects.
    Wire the strip as follow:
    BROWN -> Arduino (or power) 5 Volts
    GREEN -> Arduino Pin 6 (configurable below)
    WHITE -> Arduino (or power) Ground

    NOTE THAT THE LEDs HAVE POLARITY AND MUST HAVE THEIR DATA CONNECTED TO THE MALE CABLE (or Din on the strip itself)
